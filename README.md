# Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain Tumor Detection

This Master's level project for the *Machine Learning & Deep Learning* course at Copenhagen Business School investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as decision-support tools for brain tumor classification using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The study evaluates the performance of four models: a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) and three CNN-based architectures.

The models were trained and validated on a publicly available multi-class MRI dataset containing 11,020 images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

The objective was to assess the potential of deep learning, particularly CNNs, in automating diagnostic support in clinical radiology workflows. Among the tested models, the Advanced CNN achieved the best performance with a macro F1-score and recall of 0.98, demonstrating strong diagnostic potential.

The data was sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxwellbernard/brain-tumor-mri-multi-class-dataset).

We acheved a graded score of 12/12 for our paper. Both the jupyter notebook code and accompanying paper are available in the repository.
